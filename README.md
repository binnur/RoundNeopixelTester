# RoundNeopixelTester
Test code for Arduino with a 12-LED Neopixel "disc"

On start-up, the code waits for the button S1 to be pressed before proceeding.
Then, it reads the potentiometer and scales the LED brightness of the first few animations.
Between each animation it turns on and off LED1 and LED2 (alternating between them).
